This is my checklist which I use when I start a new service in the Internet. 

All answers should be “yes”:

* Spelling is straightforward and there is only one way to spell the name.
* If you search in google, there are no popular search results referring to the name.
* There are no popular accounts with the same name in social networks (Instagram, Twitter).
* The domain name is available for buying under TLD you choose.
* The name is not too narrow so it will leave you a capability to pivot the product.

After buying the domain name:

* register accounts in social networks (Instagram, Twitter)
* create a page on Facebook
